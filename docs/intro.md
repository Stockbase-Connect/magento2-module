# Stockbase Magento 2 Module

## Features
This is a Magento 2 module for integrating Stockbase into your Magento web shop.

Stockbase is an independent platform that is open to retailers and suppliers who are willing to work together more
intelligently and thus achieve a better return. For more information: [www.stockbase.nl](http://www.stockbase.nl)

Some of it's features:

**> Extended Magento Product Stock**

Our module extends your local stock with items for your Stockbase account.

* When you don't have enough available product in your Magento stock, this module allows you to order missing items from
Stockbase.

* Your local stock is always prioritized. Magento will always try to use your local stock first for purchases.
Stockbase stock will be used only when you don't have enough items in your local stock.


**> Automated Order Creation**

* When a customer makes an order, we always check whether your own stock is sufficient to fill the order. We order only
the shortage for you, and we notify you about this.

* Missing products will be ordered from Stockbase automatically; as a merchant, you don't have to manually place an order
on Stockbase.


**> Per-product Configuration**

You can enable Stockbase functionality for each product individually, any other products in your store will continue to
work as usual.


**> Never-out-of-stock Support**

Stockbase "never-out-of-stock" (NOOS) products will always be available to order regardless of the number of items
requested. With our module, you can allow your customers to order any number of these products.


**> Performance**

To speed everything up, we will keep your Stockbase stock copy in your Magento database and synchronize it regularly.
Your customers won't notice any difference in your website responsiveness.
