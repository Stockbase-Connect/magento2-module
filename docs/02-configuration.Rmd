## Module settings

You can find all module configuration options in your Magento admin panel:  
Navigate to **Stores** -> **Configuration** -> **Stockbase** -> **Configuration**.


The module will be disabled by default.

To enable the module, fill in all required options:

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "65%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/system-config.png")
```

#### Your Stockbase username and password {.unnumbered}

Please specify the username and password you use to access your Stockbase control panel.


#### Environment selection {.unnumbered}

This depends on your Stockbase account type. If you're not sure of the type, select **Production** mode.


#### Product EAN field {#ean-field .unnumbered}

European Article Number (also known as EAN) is used as a unique identifier of 
an individual Stockbase product.

To associate your Magento product with a Stockbase product, specify the product's EAN in an attribute.
If you don't have such attribute, you can click the **Create EAN attribute** button to create it automatically.
