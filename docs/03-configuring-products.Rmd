
# Configuring products

To enable Stockbase functionality for a product, set the **Stockbase product** attribute to `Yes` and 
associate your Magento product with the corresponding Stockbase product by filling in the **EAN** field ([configured in the module settings](#ean-field)). 

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "65%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/product-ean-attribute.png")
```

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "65%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/stockbase-product-attribute.png")
```

The module only works for the product if:

1. The product type is "Simple product."
2. The product's "Stockbase product" option is set to "Yes."
3. Back orders are disabled for the product.
4. The [EAN field](#ean-field) is not empty.
5. The local copy of the Stockbase index includes the product that has the EAN specified in the [EAN field](#ean-field).
